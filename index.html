Hi, world. My name is Lilly, I'm chronically tired <br>
    <br>
    I am sick right now and may pass out. Lolz. I love my family, dogs, friends, and boyfriend. 
    I enjoy making art by editing photos using Adobe Lightroom as well as Photoshop. <br>

  <p> When I first hear of queer gaming I think of it as an expression of one 
    self through creating games which can be considered a form of art.</p>

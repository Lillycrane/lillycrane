My name is Lilly Crane, I am a nursing major and my interests are photography, sports, family, nursing, the outdoors and more! I am always open to learning different topics and picking up different hobies to broaden my horizon! <FONT COLOR="blue">

I grew up playing video games with my family on the wii or old PS systems. I currently have an Xbox and switch. The Xbox I mainly use to watch netflix on my TV. When I do have time to play games it would be minecraft with my siblings, animal crossing or once in a while NHL.  <FONT COLOR="pink">

<br>

My family is super important to me as well as my boyfriend and his family. I’m a big family person. I am also a photographer so I do a lot of weddings, senior portraits, and engagements. This is a large part of what I do in my spare time, everyweekend I go home for photos because my business is based out of my hometown. I also love my dogs! <FONT COLOR="purple">

<br>

I am taking this course to fulfill a Fisher core but to also broaden my knowledge and courses. I have taken a lot of different classes but not one in this area so I dropped my other class because I knew a lot on the topic that class was on and joined this one to learn more about something different! <FONT COLOR="orange">

<br>

<br>

I think games and creating games is kind of a form of art so when I hear queer games I almost think it’s an expression of someone who identifies as queer. I still believe this now that it is the end of the semester but I guess the definition of this term can have many different definitions.  <FONT COLOR="brown">

<span style="background-color:darkblue">I am taking this course to broaden my knowledge and studies, I have taken a lot of different classes but not one in 
this area so I dropped my other class because I had a lot of knowledge on the topic that class was on and joined this one to learn more about a different topic.

<span style="background-color:orange">I grew up playing many different video games, I have an Xbox and a Switch now that I play. Some games I play are
Animal Crossing, Mario (cart and bros), NHL, Minecraft, Madden, etc. </>
      
<span style="background-color:purple"> I think games and creating games is kind of a form of art so when I hear queer 
  games I almost think itâ€™s an expression of someone who identifies as queer. </>

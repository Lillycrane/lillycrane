My name is Lilly Crane, I am a nursing major and my interests are photography. <br>

<span style="background-color:darkblue">I am taking this course to broaden my knowledge and studies, I have taken a lot of different classes but not one in 
this area so I dropped my other class because I had a lot of knowledge on the topic that class was on and joined this one to learn more about a different topic.

<span style="background-color:orange">I grew up playing many different video games, I have an Xbox and a Switch now that I play. Some games I play are
Animal Crossing, Mario (cart and bros), NHL, Minecraft, Madden, etc. </>

<span style="background-color:purple"> I think games and creating games is kind of a form of art so when I hear queer 
  games I almost think itâ€™s an expression of someone who identifies as queer. </>

      <span style="background-color:grey"> I have a big brother named Nate and he goes to Brockport and holds the national and state record for highschool indoor pole vault (track and field)
        and two little sisters, Harlee (13) she plays volleyball, cheer and track and Chiara (18) who was our exchange student 2 years ago and lives in Italy, we had to legally adopt her
        because of covid, she couldn't go home. She is a professional dancer!

        <br>

        <span style="background-color:black"> I have been to 3 different countries and I traveled to Europe alone at 18 to see Chiara and family. It was crazy, scary and so exciting!

            and manages carpentry for the company. We grew up racing dirt bikes and my brother raced in the semi-pro circuit.I absolutely love my family so much.

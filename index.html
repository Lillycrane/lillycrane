Hi, world. My name is Lilly, I'm chronically tired <br>
    <be>
    I am sick right now and may pass out. Lolz. I love my family, dogs, friends, and boyfriend. 
    I enjoy making art by editing photos using Adobe Lightroom as well as Photoshop. <br>

    <marquee direction="left" height="30%">
    Values: My animals, my work, my family, my boyfriend, my niece and my nephew. Love them all. 
    I miss my dogs so much.
